## Initial setup

Legend-State hooks directly into React so that it doesn't need any selectors, hooks, or higher order components.

Just call `enableLegendStateReact()` once at the beginning of your application to enable it.

```js
import { enableLegendStateReact } from "@legendapp/state/react"

enableLegendStateReact()
```

## Three ways to use observables in React

1. `get()` on observables makes the component automatically track them
2. Rendering them directly
3. `useSelector` to get individual values

## get()

Calling `get()` on an observable within any React component makes it track the accessed observables for changes. See [Tracking](../tracking) for more about when it tracks.

```jsx
const state = observable({ count: 0 })

// No HOC or selector needed
function Component() {
    // Accessing state automatically makes this component track changes to re-render
    const count = state.count.get();

    // Magic ðŸ¦„
    return <div>{count}</div>
}
```

## Rendering directly

Render an observable `string` or `number` straight into React and it will automatically be extracted as a separate memoized component with its own tracking context.

```jsx
<div>Count: {state.count}</div>
```

### Example

<Example name="Primitive">
```jsx
import { observable } from "@legendapp/state"

const count = observable(0)

function Normal() {
    // This re-renders when count changes
    return (
        <div>Count: {count.get()}</div>
    )
}
function FineGrained() {
    // This never re-renders when observable is rendered directly
    return (
        <div>Count: {count}</div>
    )
}
```
</Example>

See [fine-grained reactivity](../fine-grained-reactivity/#1-render-an-observable-directly) for more details.

## useSelector

`useSelector` computes a value and automatically listens to any observables accessed while running, and only re-renders if the computed value changes.

Props:
- `selector`: Computation function that listens to observables accessed while running

```jsx
import { observable } from "@legendapp/state"
import { useSelector } from "@legendapp/state/react"

const state = observable({ selected: 1 })

const Component = ({ id }) => {
    const isSelected = useSelector(() => id === state.selected.get())
    // Only re-renders if the return value changes

    return <div>Selected: {isSelected}</div>
}
```

See [Tracking](../tracking) for details about how Legend-State automatically tracks changes.

## enableLegendStateReact()

`enableLegendStateReact` does two things:

1. It hooks directly into React's dispatcher lifecycle to detect when component rendering begins and ends. At the beginning, it creates a new tracking context. At the end it injects a `useReducer` into the dispatcher, and subscribes any observables accessed within the component to call the reducer to re-render. This solves the same problem as other libraries' `observer` HOC or selector hooks, but is done automatically and is faster.

2. It allows rendering observables directly, by enabling observables to return the correct values that React is looking for (like "$$typeof") and returning a memoized React element that tracks the observable and renders the data.

See [enableLegendStateReact.ts](https://github.com/LegendApp/legend-state/blob/main/src/react/enableLegendStateReact.ts) if you're curious how it works.
