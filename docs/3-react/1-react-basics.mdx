## Three ways to use observables in React

1. Rendering observables directly
2. `observer` HOC enables automatically tracking observable access with the compnent
3. `useSelector` to get individual values

## Rendering directly

Render an observable `string` or `number` straight into React and it will automatically be extracted as a separate memoized component with its own tracking context. This does not need the component to be an `observer`.

You just need to call `enableLegendStateReact()` once at the beginning of your application to enable it.

```js
import { enableLegendStateReact } from "@legendapp/state/react"

enableLegendStateReact()

function Component() {
    return (
        <div>Count: {state.count}</div>
    )
}
```

See [fine-grained reactivity](../fine-grained-reactivity/#1-render-an-observable-directly) for more details.

## observer

The `observer` HOC makes the component automatically track the accessed observables for changes. See [Tracking](../tracking) for more about when it tracks.

```jsx
import { observable } from "@legendapp/state"
import { observer } from "@legendapp/state/react"

const state = observable({ count: 0 })

const Component = observer(function Component() {
    // Accessing state automatically makes this component track changes to re-render
    const count = state.count.get();

    // Magic ðŸ¦„
    return <div>{count}</div>
})
```

## useSelector

`useSelector` computes a value and automatically listens to any observables accessed while running, and only re-renders if the computed value changes.

Props:
- `selector`: Observable or computation function that listens to observables accessed while running
- `options`:
    - `forceRender`: If you already have a forceRender function or are using multiple useSelectors, you can reuse the same hook
    - `shouldRender`: `true` or `(current, previous) => boolean` to determine if the new value should trigger a render. `true` can be an optimization to run the selector only once.

```jsx
import { observable } from "@legendapp/state"
import { useSelector } from "@legendapp/state/react"

const state = observable({ selected: 1 })

const Component = ({ id }) => {
    const isSelected = useSelector(() => id === state.selected.get())
    // Only re-renders if the return value changes

    return <div>Selected: {isSelected}</div>
}
```

See [Tracking](../tracking) for details about how Legend-State automatically tracks changes.


## Considerations

For the most part you should just use whatever feels the most comfortable to you. But if you really want to get into optimizing, there are some considerations. They will likely not affect your app's performance in any meaningful way, but at large scale they can have a small impact.

- The `observer` HOC creates a memoized wrapping component which can add a small amount of overhead, so you may want to avoid it on hot path components that are used thousands of times, like items in a long list. Otherwise it's likely not noticeable.
- Rendering an observable directly creates a memoized auto-tracking component for its contents. This is normally an optimization so the parent doesn't need to re-render when it changes, but it's wasteful if the parent component would re-render anyway, so you should render the raw value rather than the observable.
- `useSelector` is the most efficient option so if a component only needs one value from observables it's the optimal way to go. If it's consuming multiple observables then reusing the `forceRender` helps, and also the efficiency over `observer` becomes less significant.
