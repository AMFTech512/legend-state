Usage of Legend-State in React Native is exactly that same as in React, so see [the React guides](../react-basics). But React Native uses different persistence:

## Persistence with mmkv

Legend-State includes a local persistence plugin for React Native that uses [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv). Install it first:

<Install name="react-native-mmkv" />

Then you can `configureObservablePersistence` with it:

```js
import { ObservablePersistMMKV } from '@legendapp/state/mmkv'
import { configureObservablePersistence } from '@legendapp/state/persist'

// Global configuration
configureObservablePersistence({
    // Use react-native-mmkv in React Native
    persistLocal: ObservablePersistMMKV
})
```

And now when you use `persistObservable` it will persist to device storage using [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv). For more information see [Persistence](../persistence).
