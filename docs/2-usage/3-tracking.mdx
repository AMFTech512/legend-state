`observe`, `when`, `computed`, `useComputed`, and React components automatically track accessing primitives through an observable and array looping functions while rendering the component, so you generally don't have to think about it unless you want to specifically optimize. When an observable is tracked, it will re-run on any changes anywhere within the observable and it's children.

These operations track:
1. Accessing a primitive through an observable: `settings.theme === 'dark'`
2. Array looping functions (shallow listener): `arr.map(settings.accounts, () => ...)`
3. Accessing array length (shallow listener): `if (arr.length > 0) ...`
4. Object.keys (shallow listener): `Object.keys(settings)`
5. Call `get()` on an observable: `settings.get()`
6. Call `obs(true)` on an observable: `settings.obs(true)`

These operation do not track:
1. Accessing an object/array through an observable: `state.settings`
2. Call `get(false)` on an observable: `settings.get(false)`
3. Call `obs()` on an observable: `settings.obs()`

Some examples of the automatic behavior:

```js
const state = observable({
    settings: {
        theme: 'dark'
    },
    chats: {
        messages: [
            { id: 0, text: 'hi' }
        ]
    }
})

observe(() => {
    // Example 1:
    const theme = state.settings.theme
    // Tracking [state.settings.theme] because it's a primitive (string)

    // Example 2:
    const settings = state.settings
    // Not tracking because it's an object

    const theme = settings.theme
    // Tracking [state.settings.theme] because it's a primitive

    // Example 3:
    const themeObs = state.settings.theme.obs();
    // Not tracking because obs() untracks primitive access

    // Example 4:
    state.chats.messages.map(m => <Message key={m.get().id} message={m} />)
    // Tracking [state.chats.messages (shallow)]

    // Example 5:
    Object.keys(state.settings)
    // Tracking [state.settings (shallow)]
})
```

The automatic behavior can be modified with two observable functions:

<div style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}>
| Function     | Value      | Tracked |
| -----------  | ---------- | ------- |
| `get()`      | raw        | yes     |
| `get(false)` | raw        | no      |
| `obs()`      | observable | no      |
| `obs(true)`  | observable | yes     |
</div>

### get()

`get` returns the raw data of an observable and tracks it, so you can work with it without doing any further tracking. You may want to use `get()` to:

- Get the value of an observable wrapper of a primitive
- Track this object and not its individual fields. Minimizing the number of listeners is better for performance.

`get()` is a tracking operation by default, but you can disable tracking with `get(false)`.


```js
    const theme = state.settings.theme.get()
    // ✅ Tracking [state.settings.theme]

    const theme = state.settings.theme.get(false)
    // ❌ Not tracked
```

### obs()

`obs` returns an observable without tracking it. You may want to use `obs()` to:

- Get an observable wrapper for a primitive value in state, to pass to a child component
- Get an observable to a value that may currently be undefined

`obs()` is a non-tracking operation by default, but you can enable tracking with `obs(true)`.

```jsx
const state = observable({ user: { name: 'Name' }})

function Component() {
    // Tracking []
    // The Input component is bound to the name property
    // Without obs it would just be a string
    return <MyInput bind={state.user.name.obs()} />
}
```

### shallow modifier

Both `get()` and `obs()` observe recursively by default, so any child changing will cause an update. You can modify it to be a shallow listener with the `Tracking` helper. This can be useful when a component only needs to re-render if an object's keys or an array's items change.

```jsx
import { Tracking } from "@legendapp/state"
const state = observable({ messages: [] })

observe(() => {
    // Only need this to update when messages added/removed
    const messages = state.messages.get(Tracking.shallow)

    console.log('Latest message', messages[0])
})
```
