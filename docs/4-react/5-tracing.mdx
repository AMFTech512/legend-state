If you notice your components feeling too slow or seeming to render too often, two helpful functions can show you exactly what observables they're listening to and why they're rendering.

## traceListeners()

Call `traceListeners()` anywhere within an `observer` to console.log a list of every observable being track for changes. This can help you find and reduce the number of listeners.

```jsx
import { traceListeners } from "legendapp/state/trace"
import { observer } from "@legendapp/state/react"

const Component = observer((props) => {

    // Call traceListeners anywhere inside the observer
    traceListeners()

    return (
        <div>{state.count}</div>
    )

    /* This logs:

    [legend-state] tracking 1 observable:
    1: count

    */
})
```

## traceUpdates()

Call `traceUpdates()` anywhere within an `observer` to console.log information about the observable change that causes each render. This can help you track down why components are rendering too often.

```jsx
import { traceUpdates } from "legendapp/state/trace"
import { observer } from "@legendapp/state/react"

const Component = observer((props) => {
    // Call traceUpdates anywhere inside the observer
    traceUpdates()

    return (
        <div>{state.count}</div>
    )

    /* This logs:

    [legend-state] Rendering because "count" changed:
    from: 0
    to: 1

    */
})
```

## What to do with this information

- You may want to call `get()` at a higher level in an object to only listen to it, and not every single child.
- `get(Tracking.shallow)` will only update when keys are added to or removed from the object.
- If you're passing primitives down to children, call `obs()` on it to get a reference to it without listening to it.
- You may want to call `get()` to not listen at all.

If you find an observable changing often and you're not sure why, you can put a breakpoint on the console log to catch it. Or add your own listener to the observable to watch every change:
```js
// Why is count rendering so often?
state.count.onChange(value => {
    console.log('Count changed', value);
    console.trace();
    debugger;
})
```
