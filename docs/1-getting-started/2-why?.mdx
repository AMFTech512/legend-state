Legend-State is an evolution of the state system we've been using internally in [Legend](https://www.legendapp.com) since 2015 and in [Bravely](https://www.bravely.io) since 2020. It needs to be extremely fast because Legend users have documents with hundreds of thousands of items. We recently rewrote it with modern browser features, optimizing for both developer experience and best possible performance / memory usage. Comparing to other state libraries, we think you'll prefer Legend-State for these reasons:


## Tiny and FAST ‚ö°Ô∏è

Legend-State is the [fastest React state library](../fast), designed to be as efficient as possible. It does very little extra work and minimizes renders by only re-rendering components when their observables change. And at only `3kb` it won't hurt your bundle size.


## Feels natural üòå

There's no easier way to read state than just reading it. There are no special hooks, functions, Contexts, or other boilerplate required to work with observables. Observable objects work as you'd expect, and the observable functions are right there on the prototype.

```js
const obs = observable({ value: 1 })
obs.value === 1 // true
obs.value = 2
```


## Fine-grained reactivity

Legend-State has [built-in helpers](../fine-grained-reactivity) to easily extract children so that their changes do not affect the parent. This keeps large parent components from rendering often just because their children change.

<Example name="Memo">
```jsx
const MemoExample = observer(() => {
    const renderCount = ++useRef(0).current
    const state = useObservable({ count: 0 })

    useInterval(() => {
        state.count.set(c => c + 1)
    }, 500)

    return (
        <div>
            <div>Renders: {renderCount}</div>
            <Memo>
                <div>Count: {state.count}</div>
            </Memo>
        </div>
    )
})
```
</Example>

## Unopinionated ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Some state libraries are for global state while some want state to reside within React. Some enourage individual atoms and others are for large global stores. Some have "actions" and "reducers" and others require immutability. But you can use Legend-State any way you want.

- **In React or external**: Up to you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Individual atoms or one store**: Up to you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Direct use or actions/reducers**: Up to you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

See [Patterns](../patterns) for more examples of different ways to use Legend-State.


## Persistence built in üíæ

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. - Phil Karlton

We don't want developers to have to worry about persisting and syncing state, because it's often very complicated and error-prone. So we've built [persistence](../persistence) plugins using Legend-State's listeners, with extensive tests to make sure it's absolutely correct.

It currently includes plugins for local persistence with Local Storage on web and [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) in React Native, with more persistence plugins coming soon, including persisting remotely to Firebase.

```js
const state = observable({ settings: { theme: 'dark' } })

persistObservable(state, { local: 'exampleState' })
```


## It's safe from üî´ footguns

Observables warn when assigning while rendering or when assigning a DOM element. [Safe mode](../observable#safe-mode) can even prevent direct assignment, favoring more purposeful `set` and `assign` functions instead.
