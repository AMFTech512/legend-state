## Equality

While observables are interactable like any other object, it's important to note that because they are Proxies they are not always strictly equal to their source objects, which is why `observable` has a `get()` function. Primitive children of observables are exposed as true primitives, but accessing objects or the root of an observable returns a Proxy.

For most purposes you can interact with the Observable directly. They have the same keys as their source, they can be serialized normally, and they are loosely equal to their underlying data (`JSON.stringify` will be equal). But because they are Proxy objects, they are not strictly equal to their original data.

So to get the true value for equality purposes you need to use `get()`.

```js
const originalItem = { text: 'hello' }
const obs = observable({ item: originalItem })

obs.item === originalItem // ❌ false. The observable is not strictly equal.
obs.item.get() === originalItem // ✅ true. The raw data is exactly what was set.
obs.item.text === 'hello'  // ✅ true. Primitives are exposed as their actual value.
```

## Usage tracking

Legend-State extends the prototype of `Number`, `Boolean`, and `String` to add the observable functions. The extended prototypes on primitive values depend on the primitive being the last observable accessed. For most usage that works as expected, but it can break down if you save primitives and try to access them later.

So for example if you save a `set` function then work with other observables it may not remain bound correctly. But you can save a reference to the observable of the primitive with `obs()`.

```js
import { setter } from '@legendapp/state'

const obs = observable({ text1: 'hello', text2: 'hi' })

const setBad = obs.text1.set
const setGood = obs.text1.obs().set

obs.text2.set('hi there') // setBad becomes broken by accessing a different primitive

setBad('hello there')  // ❌ Error. setBad is no longer bound to the right primitive.

setGood('hello there') // ✅ Works! It remains bound correctly because of obs().
```
