Legend-State is designed to be high performance so it should be well optimized without having to think about it. But there are some considerations to keep in mind.

Note: This page is under construction after a recent change in how Legend-State is consumed from React. More tips coming soon!

## Batch multiple changes

Modifying multiple observables in a row can re-compute computed observables, re-render React components, or write to storage multiple times if [persisting](../persistence). You can delay listener notification until after all writes to notify only once.

See [Batching](../batching) for more details.

```js
import { batch } from "@legendapp/state"

const obs = observable({ items: [] })

function addItems() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i ++) {
        obs.items.push({ text: `Item ${i}` })
    }
}

// ❌ This can notify listeners 1000 times while pushing to the array
addItems()

// ✅ This notifies once when all changes are complete
batch(addItems)
```

## Iterating through observables creates Proxies

For most usage this effect is negligible, but may be a concern with huge arrays of objects.

Accessing objects/arrays in observables creates Proxies to give them the observable functions. If you are iterating through large objects that don't need to be tracked for changes, call `get()` first to access the raw data, skipping all the Proxy creation.

```js
const obs = observable({ items: [{ data: { value: 10 }}, ...] })

let sum = 0

// 🔥 This will create proxies for each element's data and value
obs.items.forEach(item => sum += item.data.value.get())

// 💨 This will not do anything special
obs.items.get().forEach(item => sum += item.data.value)
```
