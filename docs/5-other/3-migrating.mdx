## 0.19 to 0.20

### Removed deprecated automatic observing

The automatic observing from 0.18 was deprecated in 0.19 and is now removed. See [Deprecated automatic observing](#deprecated-automatic-observing).

### observe and useObserve

As `observe` has gotten more and more powerful, it outgrew modifying behavior based on the return value, so it now has an event parameter to control canceling listening and a cleanup function.

- If you were returning false to cancel observing, you can now use `e.cancel = true`.
- If you were returning a cleanup function you can use `e.onCleanup = () => ...`.
- It also adds a `num` param to know how many times it's run and a `previous` param to compare to the previous value.

```js
observe((e) => {
    // Cancel observing any future changes
    e.cancel = true

    // A cleanup function
    e.cleanup = () => ...
})
```

### Renamed event `dispatch` to `fire`

Just change `evt.dispatch()` to `evt.fire()` and all is good üëç.


## 0.18 to 0.19

### Deprecated automatic observing

We are deprecating the automatic observing that depended on hooking into React's internals. Components will no longer track observables automatically, but you can easily it per component in a few ways:

- Wrap components in `observer` to make them track automatically
- Wrap observable access in `useSelector` to return a value and track automatically.
- Render observables directly into JSX.

So tracking observables in React can look like this now:

```jsx
import { observer } from "@legendapp/state/react"

const Component = observer(function Component() {
    const value = observable.get();
    // This tracks because it's inside an observer
})
```

or

```jsx
import { useSelector } from "@legendapp/state/react"

function Component() {
    // Track the value of an observable
    const value = useSelector(observable)

    // Track the return value of a function
    const isSelected = useSelector(() => id === state.selected.get())
}
```

See [the React guide](../react-basics) for how we suggest setting up your components now.

Rendering observables directly still works though, and `enableLegendStateReact()` still enables that.

You can still enable the previous behavior for now with `enableLegendStateReact({ autoTrackingDEPRECATED: true })` while you migrate to using `observer` or `useSelector`. That option will be removed before we reach 1.0.

#### Why

- It doesn't actually work. We thought this method would be safe to use because it was inspired by Preact Signals, but as we've integrated Legend-State into more environments we found significant edge cases that seem to be unfixable and suggest that the whole concept is just unworkable.
- The React team has asked us not to do it and made it clear that it is likely to break in a future version of React.
- As Legend-State has evolved, the ideal way of using it has shifted towards fine-grained reactivity where components render minimally or only once, and we were actually specifically opting out of auto-tracking more often than not. So in the interest of pursuing the render-once ideal, we think it's actually generally better to use the [reactivity components](../fine-grained-reactivity) or opt-in to tracking.
- We don't want to distract from the core mission of Legend-State with an unreliable and unstable core.

### Bindable components deprecated

We now have a more general purpose way of making reactive props that can also be used for two-way binding for inputs. So change:

```jsx
<Bindable.input bind={observable} />
```

to

```jsx
import { legend } from "@legendapp/state/react-components"

<legend.input value$={observable} />
```

See [reactive props](../reactive-props) for more detauls.

### `value` is no longer exposed

Primitives no longer have a `value` that you could access and modify. We had previously removed that from the documentation and it is now removed from the code. You can just `get()` and `set()` as you would any other observable. It turned out to cause more bugs than it was worth and made the TypeScript types overly complex.

### Removed get(false)

Use `peek()` instead.


## 0.17 to 0.18

The tracing functions are renamed to use* to be inline with hooks:
- useTraceListeners
- useTraceUpdates
- useVerifyNotTracking
- useVerifyOneRender (new)

## 0.16 to 0.17

### Primitives are now returned as observables

Observables previously tried to be clever by returning primitives directly, which was great in making it easy to work with state directly. But especially as the goal has moved more towards fine-grained reactivity, the balance shifted towards observable objects being better. So accessing primitives through state now returns observables like anything else.

#### Raw primitives:
- Pro: Easy to work with
- Con: Required `obs()` to get the observable to pass to props or render directly
- Con: Easy to track a value without realizing it

#### Observable primitives
- Pro: More consistent
- Pro: Easier to deal with undefined
- Pro: Can dot through undefined paths easily
- Pro: Doesn‚Äôt need `obs()` or set by key
- Pro: Easier to use fine-grained features without `obs()` everywhere
- Pro: Easier to pass as props without needing `obs()`
- Con: Requires `get()` for primitives

#### Changes to make:

**get()**

Wherever you were accessing primitives directly, add a `.get()` to the end of it.

**set(key, value)**

Change set by key to access the node first. It will now work fine if the node is undefined.

From: `state.profile.set('name', 'Annyong')`

To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`state.profile.name.set('Annyong')`

**obs()**

Just remove it. The default behavior is now the same as what `obs()` did before.

### Hooks renamed

`useComputed` is now `useSelector`, re-rendering only when the return value changes.

`useComputed` now returns a `computed` observable.



## 0.15 to 0.16

### enableLegendStateReact() to observe, removed observer

Legend-State now automatically tracks observable access in any component. To set it up, just call `enableLegendStateReact()` at the beginning of your app.

Now `observer` is no longer needed, so just remove all usage of `observer`.

## 0.14 to 0.15

### Safety

There are now three levels of safety: **Unsafe**, **Default**, and **Safe**. Default is new and allows direct assignment to primitives but prevents directly assigning to everything else. The previous default behavior was Unsafe so you may see errors if you were directly assigning to objects/arrays/etc... TypeScript should show errors so it should be easy to find them. Replace those with `.set(...)` or pass in `false` as the second parameter to `observable` to go back to "Unsafe" mode.

```js
// 1. Unsafe: Use false for the previous unsafe behavior
const obs = observable({ ... }, /*safe*/ false)

// 2. Default: The new default behavior prevent directly assigning to objects, but allows directly assining to primitives
const obs = observable({ text: 'hello',  obj: {} })

obs.text = 'hi'
// ‚úÖ Setting a primitive works in default mode but not in safe mode.

obs.obj = {}
// ‚ùå Error. Cannot assign to objects directly.

// 3. Safe: Safe mode prevents all direct assignment
const obs = observable({ text: 'hello',  obj: {} }, /*safe*/true)

obs.text = 'hi'
// ‚ùå Error. Cannot assign directly in safe mode.
```

### Renamed ref to obs

`ref` was a bit unclear and conflicted with React - the new feature to  [directly render observables](../fine-grained-reactivity/#render-an-observable-directly) requires a `ref` property. So it is now renamed to `obs`, which feels more intuitive as it is used to get an observable.

```js
const state = observable({ text: '' })

// Before
const textRef = state.ref('text')
const textRef2 = state.text.ref()

// Now
const textObs = obs.obs('text')
const textObs2 = obs.text.obs()
```

### Array optimizations

The array optimizations are now opt-in, because they are only useful in React and can potentially have some unexpected behavior in React if modifying the DOM externally. You can enable them by using the `For` component with the `optimized` prop. See [Arrays](../arrays) for more.

```jsx
const obs = observable({ items: [] })

const Row = observer(function Row({ item }) {
    return <div>{item.text}</div>
})

const List = observer(function () {
    // The optimized prop enables the optimizations which were previously default
    return <For each={list} item={Row} optimized />
})
```

### Shallow

Since there's now a additionally the `optimized` tracking for arrays, the shallow option on `get()` and `obs()` now has another option. So instead of passing `shallow` to an observable, use the `Tracking` namespace now.

```js
import { Tracking } from '@legendapp/state'

const obs = observable([])

// Before
obs.get(shallow)

// Now
obs.get(Tracking.shallow)
```

### Batching

The `observableBatcher` namespace is removed and the batching functions are now exported on their own.

```js
import { batch, beginBatch, endBatch } from '@legendapp/state'

// begin/end
beginBatch()
obs1.set(...)
obs2.set(...)
endBatch()

// batch()
batch(() => {
    obs1.set(...)
    obs2.set(...)
}
```

### Change functions => observe/when

The new `observe` and `when` functions can automatically track all observables accessed while running them. This made the old extra change utilities unnecessary, so `onTrue`, `onHasValue`, `onEquals`, and `onChangeShallow` have been removed, saving 200 bytes (7%) from the bundle size. These are the new equivalents:

```js
import { observe, when } from "@legendapp/state"

const obs = observable({ value: undefined })

// onTrue
obs.value.onTrue(handler)
// New onTrue equivalent
when(() => obs.value === true, handler)

// onHasValue
obs.value.onHasValue('text', handler)
// onHasValue equivalent
when(() => obs.value, handler)

// onEquals
obs.value.onEquals('text', handler)
// onEquals equivalent
when(() => obs.value === 'text', handler)

// onChangeShallow
obs.value.onChangeShallow(handler)
// onChangeShallow equivalent
obs.value.onChange(handler, { shallow: true })
```

### Primitive current => value

Primitive observables are now wrapped in `{ value }` instead of `{ current }`. You can also now modify the `value` directly.

```js
const obs = observable(10)
// Before
obs.current === 10
obs.curent = 20 // ‚ùå Error
// Now
obs.value === 10
obs.value = 20 // ‚úÖ Works
```

### Renamed observableComputed and observableEvent

`observableComputed` is now just `computed` and `observableEvent` is now just `event`.

```js
import { computed, event } from '@legendapp/state'

// Before
const value = observableComputed(() => ...)
// Now
const value = computed(() => ...)

// Before
const evt = observableEvent(() => ...)
// Now
const evt = event(() => ...)
```

### Renamed LS to Bindable

The automatically bound exports are now named better and in their own exports, so change your exports from `LS` to:

```js
// Web
import { Bindable } from '@legendapp/state/react-components'

// React Native
import { Bindable } from '@legendapp/state/react-native-components'
```

### Renamed Isolate to Computed

The control flow component `Isolate` is renamed to `Computed` for naming consistency.

### Removed memo and isolate props

We found these confusing in practice as it wasn't super clear when a component was getting memoized, and it's not much extra work to use the Memo and Computed components directly. If you were using those, switch to the Computed and Memo components instead

```jsx
// Before
<div memo>...</div>
<div computed>...</div>

// Now
<Memo><div>...</div></Memo>
<Computed><div>...</div></Computed>
