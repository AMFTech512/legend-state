### Primitives are now returned as observables

Observables previously tried to be clever by returning primitives directly, which was great in making it easy to work with state directly. But especially as the goal has moved more towards fine-grained reactivity, the balance shifted towards observable objects being better. So accessing primitives through state now returns observables like anything else.

#### Raw primitives:
- Pro: Easy to work with
- Con: Required `obs()` to get the observable to pass to props or render directly
- Con: Easy to track a value without realizing it

#### Observable primitives
- Pro: More consistent
- Pro: Easier to deal with undefined
- Pro: Can dot through undefined paths easily
- Pro: Doesn’t need `obs()` or set by key
- Pro: Easier to use fine-grained features without `obs()` everywhere
- Pro: Easier to pass as props without needing `obs()`
- Con: Requires `get()` for primitives

#### Changes to make:

**get()**

Wherever you were accessing primitives directly, add a `.get()` to the end of it.

**set(key, value)**

Change set by key to access the node first. It will now work fine if the node is undefined.

From: `state.profile.set('name', 'Annyong')`

To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`state.profile.name.set('Annyong')`

**obs()**

Just remove it. The default behavior is now the same as what `obs()` did before.

### Hooks renamed

`useComputed` is now `useSelector`, re-rendering only when the return value changes.

`useComputed` now returns a `computed` observable.

### enableLegendStateReact() to observe, removed observer

Legend-State now automatically tracks observable access in any component. To set it up, just call `enableLegendStateReact()` at the beginning of your app.

Now `observer` is no longer needed, so just remove all usage of `observer`.

## 0.14 to 0.15

### Safety

There are now three levels of safety: **Unsafe**, **Default**, and **Safe**. Default is new and allows direct assignment to primitives but prevents directly assigning to everything else. The previous default behavior was Unsafe so you may see errors if you were directly assigning to objects/arrays/etc... TypeScript should show errors so it should be easy to find them. Replace those with `.set(...)` or pass in `false` as the second parameter to `observable` to go back to "Unsafe" mode.

```js
// 1. Unsafe: Use false for the previous unsafe behavior
const obs = observable({ ... }, /*safe*/ false)

// 2. Default: The new default behavior prevent directly assigning to objects, but allows directly assining to primitives
const obs = observable({ text: 'hello',  obj: {} })

obs.text = 'hi'
// ✅ Setting a primitive works in default mode but not in safe mode.

obs.obj = {}
// ❌ Error. Cannot assign to objects directly.

// 3. Safe: Safe mode prevents all direct assignment
const obs = observable({ text: 'hello',  obj: {} }, /*safe*/true)

obs.text = 'hi'
// ❌ Error. Cannot assign directly in safe mode.
```

### Renamed ref to obs

`ref` was a bit unclear and conflicted with React - the new feature to  [directly render observables](../fine-grained-reactivity/#render-an-observable-directly) requires a `ref` property. So it is now renamed to `obs`, which feels more intuitive as it is used to get an observable.

```js
const state = observable({ text: '' })

// Before
const textRef = state.ref('text')
const textRef2 = state.text.ref()

// Now
const textObs = obs.obs('text')
const textObs2 = obs.text.obs()
```

### Array optimizations

The array optimizations are now opt-in, because they are only useful in React and can potentially have some unexpected behavior in React if modifying the DOM externally. You can enable them by using the `For` component with the `optimized` prop. See [Arrays](../arrays) for more.

```jsx
const obs = observable({ items: [] })

const Row = observer(function Row({ item }) {
    return <div>{item.text}</div>
})

const List = observer(function () {
    // The optimized prop enables the optimizations which were previously default
    return <For each={list} item={Row} optimized />
})
```

### Shallow

Since there's now a additionally the `optimized` tracking for arrays, the shallow option on `get()` and `obs()` now has another option. So instead of passing `shallow` to an observable, use the `Tracking` namespace now.

```js
import { Tracking } from '@legendapp/state'

const obs = observable([])

// Before
obs.get(shallow)

// Now
obs.get(Tracking.shallow)
```

### Batching

The `observableBatcher` namespace is removed and the batching functions are now exported on their own.

```js
import { batch, beginBatch, endBatch } from '@legendapp/state'

// begin/end
beginBatch()
obs1.set(...)
obs2.set(...)
endBatch()

// batch()
batch(() => {
    obs1.set(...)
    obs2.set(...)
}
```

### Change functions => observe/when

The new `observe` and `when` functions can automatically track all observables accessed while running them. This made the old extra change utilities unnecessary, so `onTrue`, `onHasValue`, `onEquals`, and `onChangeShallow` have been removed, saving 200 bytes (7%) from the bundle size. These are the new equivalents:

```js
import { observe, when } from "@legendapp/state"

const obs = observable({ value: undefined })

// onTrue
obs.value.onTrue(handler)
// New onTrue equivalent
when(() => obs.value === true, handler)

// onHasValue
obs.value.onHasValue('text', handler)
// onHasValue equivalent
when(() => obs.value, handler)

// onEquals
obs.value.onEquals('text', handler)
// onEquals equivalent
when(() => obs.value === 'text', handler)

// onChangeShallow
obs.value.onChangeShallow(handler)
// onChangeShallow equivalent
obs.value.onChange(handler, { shallow: true })
```

### Primitive current => value

Primitive observables are now wrapped in `{ value }` instead of `{ current }`. You can also now modify the `value` directly.

```js
const obs = observable(10)
// Before
obs.current === 10
obs.curent = 20 // ❌ Error
// Now
obs.value === 10
obs.value = 20 // ✅ Works
```

### Renamed observableComputed and observableEvent

`observableComputed` is now just `computed` and `observableEvent` is now just `event`.

```js
import { computed, event } from '@legendapp/state'

// Before
const value = observableComputed(() => ...)
// Now
const value = computed(() => ...)

// Before
const evt = observableEvent(() => ...)
// Now
const evt = event(() => ...)
```

### Renamed LS to Bindable

The automatically bound exports are now named better and in their own exports, so change your exports from `LS` to:

```js
// Web
import { Bindable } from '@legendapp/state/react-components'

// React Native
import { Bindable } from '@legendapp/state/react-native-components'
```

### Renamed Isolate to Computed

The control flow component `Isolate` is renamed to `Computed` for naming consistency.

### Removed memo and isolate props

We found these confusing in practice as it wasn't super clear when a component was getting memoized, and it's not much extra work to use the Memo and Computed components directly. If you were using those, switch to the Computed and Memo components instead

```jsx
// Before
<div memo>...</div>
<div computed>...</div>

// Now
<Memo><div>...</div></Memo>
<Computed><div>...</div></Computed>
